# Background Image

Place your custom background image here.

## Instructions:

1. Add your background image file to this folder (e.g., `background.jpg`, `background.png`, etc.)
2. Update the CSS file `css/main.css` and change the path in the `.desktop` class:
   - Find: `url('../images/background.jpg')`
   - Replace with: `url('../images/your-image-name.jpg')`

## Recommended Image Specifications:

- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Size**: 1920x1080 or larger for best quality
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 works well for most screens
- **Style**: Retro/vintage images work best with the theme
- **File Size**: Keep under 2MB for faster loading

## Tips:

- The image will be automatically scaled to cover the entire desktop
- A semi-transparent overlay is applied to maintain readability
- You can adjust the overlay opacity in `css/main.css` by changing the `rgba(139, 115, 85, 0.4)` values
